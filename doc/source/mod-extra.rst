Extra modules
=============

Here are the unclassifiable things, which do not fall into the previous categories. None of them are
essential, nor even to be known, but they contribute in easing nROS usage.

For instance, when creating simple demonstrators for nodes added to collection, I found myself
doing a lot of copy/paste from previous ones. What appeared as boiler plate code has thus been consolidated
as the module :py:mod:`nros.core.demo`, to provide a simple architecture allowing a fast and easy
development process of new demonstrators. The added benefit is that all the resulting demonstrators
share the same look and feel and the same UI principles.
